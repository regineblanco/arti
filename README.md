# arti
arti is a social media website that allows users to post about themselves and see updates from their friends as well.

The concept is a hybrid of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/login">Tumblr</a>-- in a sense that users can only post a photo one by one, and like Tumblr, they can also post texts. Users can also "like" or "dislike" posts, add captions to photos, view profiles-- which are designed like Instagram, and edit their profile photo and description.

It is my first foray into object-oriented programming and the usage of a framework, in this case-- Laravel, for PHP.

<h3>Features</h3>

<li>Laravel framework for PHP</li>
